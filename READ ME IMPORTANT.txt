Some of these Matlab scripts (anything using screen) will not
work without the "Psychtoolbox-3" zip folder in the google drive. 

You MUST extract it inside VirtualScan-Serial-IO (where this file
is currently located that you're reading from)

Git has a storage limit so I had to put it here. 


Access the google drive folder here:

Hopefully this project helps at least one person lol. 


You must also have Virtual Serial Port Driver Pro downloaded
with a connection between COM2 and COM3.

Order to run everything:

1) inputSerialPortAndWriteFiles.m (opens receiving port)
2) ISCANeyeTrackerVirtualOutputSerialPort.py (opens sending port)
3) Unity Scene
Watch the program work...

4) Close everything (Ctrl + C)
5) closePorts.m

Now you're free to open the .txt's in LocalMatlabScripts!
